# chess

A two player chess game I made in Java like 4 years ago and just found. I didn't change anything before uploading it to Github so look at the code at your own risk.

## Installation

### with ant:
Clone the project and run the commands:
```
$ ant
$ ant ChessDriver
```

Or just import the project into Eclipse or another Java IDE.
